## Introduction

Almost every application nowadays, requires a database to persist data. We have integrated [`ObjectionJS`](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/) as our supported ORM.

`ObjectionJS` provides very clean and fluent APIs to build and run complex queries at ease. We have worked in the past with many ORMs, but `ObjectionJS` stood out, it is relatively young but more mature in terms of its offerings.

**Why we ❤️ ObjectionJS**:

- ✅ Very clean and mature Query Builder
- ✅ Fluent Relational Queries
- ✅ Official Typescript Support
- ✅ Clean Migrations and Seeders using [`KnexJS`](http://knexjs.org/)
- ✅ Support for Hooks
- ✅ Powerful model entity relation operations
- ✅ Easy to use Transactions

**What we have added on top of it?**:

- ✅ Setting up project is now much easier than ever
- ✅ Custom `BaseModel` having performant functions
- ✅ In-built `DatabaseRepository` to help you maintain data store functions smartly
- ✅ Beautiful console commands to manage migrations
- ✅ Custom `QueryBuilder` with some much needed methods
- ✅ Utilise multiple connections in repositories smartly.
